// This is a linked List problem that can be done iterativly or recursivly. I tried to do
// recursive but it was harder than I thought. I need to practice a little more on my recursion.
// However, I understood the iteration way.
// The idea is that you need to keep a temp variable that stores everything else than the first 
// variable in your curr and your PREV variable keeps track of your reverse order of nodes
